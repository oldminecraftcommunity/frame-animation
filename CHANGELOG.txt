a1.1.0
- Added edit mode.
Since this release you have to manually select animations to use in quick pick via edit mode.
You can enter edit mode by clicking button or using keybind (defaults to R) in animation selection menu.
- Added walk in GUI setting.
- Added `interpolate` tag that enables interpolation.
This tag applies to whole animation same as `interruptible` and `resetarms` do.
As of now there is no support for interpolation toggle in frames.
- You can now toggle F5 in animations GUI.
- Other minor GUI changes.
- Frame Animation protocol version bump (to 3).

a1.0.6
- Fixed bad packet id 99 on unsupported servers.
- Fixed bug when you couldn't walk in menu after switching to other animation while some interruptable is playing.
- Added settings.
- Added fast keybinds.
- Added `resetarms` tag that removes idle animation.
- Button text now changes color on hover.
- Script syntax is now case-insensitive (completely).
- Frame Animation protocol version bump (to 2).

Version bump means that a1.0.6 is now incompatible with a1.0.5 and earlier so since this release server version and client version have to match in order to play multiplayer.
